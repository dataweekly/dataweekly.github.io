By now, you have probably heard of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), especially if you are data analyst or someone who is responsible for moving data from one system to another. One of the questions many people ask when first learning about HDFS is: How do I get my existing data into the HDFS? In this article, we will examine how to import data from a PostgreSQL database into HDFS...</p>
